🛍️ E-commerce User Behavior and Category Operation Insights


📊 Overview

This project analyzes e-commerce user behavior and category performance data collected between November 25 and December 3, a period that includes two weekends and the lead-up to the “Double 12” shopping festival.
The analysis explores how user engagement, retention, and conversion dynamics fluctuate during this critical sales phase.
By combining user activity, traffic metrics, and category-level performance, the project provides data-driven operational insights to optimize promotional timing, category strategies, and user conversion efficiency.

🧠 Project Objectives

User Retention Analysis — Examine 1-day and 3-day retention trends, highlighting the impact of weekends and pre–“Double 12” promotions.

User Traffic Overview — Analyze page views (PV), unique visitors (UV), and browsing depth (PV/UV) to reveal temporal patterns and campaign-driven surges.

User Behavior Timeline — Identify hourly activity peaks to guide the optimal timing for marketing campaigns and push notifications.

User Flow & Funnel Conversion — Evaluate user journeys from browsing to purchase, quantify conversion drop-offs, and identify mid-funnel leakage points.

User Profiling (RFC Model) — Segment users by Recency, Frequency, and Cart/Favorite engagement to assess user value and churn risk.

Category Performance Analysis — Compare browsing and sales dynamics across top categories to uncover conversion inefficiencies and operational opportunities.

Category Feature — Map categories by traffic (PV) and sales (BUY) into four strategic types: Bestselling, High-Potential, Niche, and Declining.
